* UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt - description of the measurement variables

## Data Dictionary for summarydata.txt
All of the average variables in the dataset are calculated per activityname per subjectid for the listed raw variable

1. subjectid - integer identifying the subject
2. activityname - name of the activity for which the measurements were taken
  + LAYING
  + SITTING
  + STANDING
  + WALKING
  + WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  + WALKING_UPSTAIRS
